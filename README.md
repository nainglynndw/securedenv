# SecuredEnv

üîê **Secure environment variable encryption and management for cross-platform projects**

SecuredEnv provides a simple yet powerful way to encrypt, backup, and manage environment variables across different projects and platforms. It uses military-grade AES-256-GCM encryption with enhanced key derivation to keep your sensitive data secure.

## Features

- üîí **Military-grade encryption** - AES-256-GCM with triple-layer PBKDF2 key derivation (650,000+ iterations)
- üåç **Cross-platform support** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- üìÅ **Project isolation** - Each project has its own encrypted storage
- üîÑ **Backup & Restore** - Secure backup and restore of environment files
- üì§ **Import/Export** - Share encrypted environment files between machines
- üõ°Ô∏è **Strong password validation** - Enforces secure password requirements
- üì± **CLI & Library** - Use as a command-line tool or programmatic library
- üöÄ **Auto-detection** - Automatically finds and handles all .env\* files

## Installation

### As a CLI tool (global)

```bash
npm install -g securedenv
```

### Use without installing

```bash
npx secenv --help
```

## CLI Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Backup all environment files in current project
secenv backup --key "YourStrongPassword123!"

# Restore environment files for current project
secenv restore --key "YourStrongPassword123!"

# Export backup to a file
secenv export --key "YourStrongPassword123!" --file "./my-backup.secenv"

# Import backup from a file
secenv import --key "YourStrongPassword123!" --file "./my-backup.secenv"
```

### Use without installing (with npx)

```bash
# If installed as dev dependency, use npx
npx secenv backup --key "YourStrongPassword123!"
npx secenv restore --key "YourStrongPassword123!"
npx secenv export --key "YourStrongPassword123!" --file "./backup.secenv"
npx secenv import --key "YourStrongPassword123!" --file "./backup.secenv"
```

### Real-world Workflow

```bash
# 1. In your project directory with .env files
cd /path/to/your/project

# 2. Backup your environment files
secenv backup --key "MySecurePassword123!"

# 3. Later, restore them (maybe after deleted local project or env and then clone from git)
secenv restore --key "MySecurePassword123!"

# 4. Export for sharing with team
secenv export --key "MySecurePassword123!" --file "./prod-env.secenv"

# 5. On another machine, import the backup
secenv import --key "MySecurePassword123!" --file "./prod-env.secenv"
```

## Security Features

### Encryption Details

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- **Key Derivation**: Triple-layer PBKDF2 with 650,000+ total iterations
- **Salt**: 32-byte random salt per encryption
- **IV**: 16-byte random initialization vector per encryption
- **Authentication**: Built-in authentication tag prevents tampering

### Password Requirements

- Minimum 12 characters
- Must contain uppercase letters
- Must contain lowercase letters
- Must contain numbers
- Must contain special characters
- Cannot contain common passwords

```bash
# ‚úÖ Strong passwords (accepted)
--key "MyProject2024!Backup#789"
--key "Secure&Environment$Keys2024"
--key "Company!Production@Secrets#2024"

# ‚ùå Weak passwords (rejected)
--key "password123"          # Too common
--key "mypassword"           # No numbers/symbols
--key "SHORT1!"              # Too short
```

### Storage Security

- Binary format prevents casual inspection
- XOR obfuscation adds additional layer
- Magic headers for file format validation
- Platform-specific secure storage locations

### Attack Resistance

```
Dictionary Attack Time with Enhanced Security:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Weak password blocked by validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Strong password: ~10^18 years to crack
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Project-specific entropy: Can't reuse attacks across projects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 650,000 iterations: 6.5x slower than standard PBKDF2
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Cross-platform compatible: Same project, same key (any OS/user)
```

## Storage Locations

SecuredEnv stores encrypted backups in platform-appropriate locations:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\SecuredEnv`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/SecuredEnv`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/securedenv`

Each project gets its own subdirectory based on a hash of the project name.

## How It Works

### Project Identity

- Projects are identified by **folder name** (not full path)
- `my-project` folder = same project regardless of location
- Works across different machines/paths

### Storage Architecture

- Encrypted backups stored in platform-specific directories
- Each project gets isolated storage using SHA256 hash
- No conflicts between different projects
- Binary format for enhanced security

## Environment File Detection

SecuredEnv automatically detects these environment file patterns:

- `.env`
- `.env.local`
- `.env.development`
- `.env.staging`
- `.env.production`
- `.env.test`
- Any `.env.*` pattern

**Excluded files:**

- `.env.example`
- `.env.template`
- `*.secenv` (backup files)
